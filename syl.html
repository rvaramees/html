    <h1>HTTP request methods</h1>
<img src="index.png">
            HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.
        
      
        
            The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
           
        
            The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
          
        
            The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
         
        
            The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
        
        
            The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
         
        
            The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
         
        
            The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
        
        
            The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
         
        
            The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

<h1> Http Response status codes</h1><p>
<img src="index2.png">
In HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (such as "404") and a textual reason phrase (such as "Not Found"). The response status code is a three-digit integer code representing the result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's corresponding request. The way the client handles the response depends primarily on the status code, and secondarily on the other response header fields. Clients may not understand all registered status codes but they must understand their class (given by the first digit of the status code) and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class.

The standard reason phrases are only recommendations, and can be replaced with "local equivalents" at the web developer's discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the reason phrase to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase, though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and reason phrases are human-readable.

The first digit of the status code defines its class:

1XX (informational)
    The request was received, continuing process.

2XX (successful)
    The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

3XX (redirection)
    Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.

4XX (client error)
    The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

5XX (server error)
    The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

Response header fields
See also: List of HTTP header fields ยง Response fields

The response header fields allow the server to pass additional information beyond the status line, acting as response modifiers. They give information about the server or about further access to the target resource or related resources.

Each response header field has a defined meaning which can be further refined by the semantics of the request method or response status code.

    <h1>Dynamic Webpages</h1>
    <p>
    A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime (during software execution), as opposed to a static web page, delivered as it is stored. A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing. A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model (DOM), to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there is not any server-side code included.
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server. A particular application server could offer a standardized REST style interface to offer services to the web application.[1]
DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.
